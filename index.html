	<h1>Having fun seeing codes grow to life</h1>
	<p>Coding is focus intensive process, a creation of logic and artistic combination. This is where the left and right brain break the wall between them to cooperate. It's hard. But rewarding when the codes run and come to life. It's this moment that all the burden washed off programmers shoulder. Shortly after, the bugs started to appear and infest the piece of art. Bugs get ridden. Glad. Bugs appear. Fight again. Never ending cycles. It's like a sudden surge of bad mood, ego challenged feeling, and next few moment glory sunk the bad.</p>

	<p>It's a great life being a programmer, at least you don't have to fist fight</p>
